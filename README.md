# RoboticCarArduino
These codes are used for an arduino-based Elegoo Smart Robotic Car. The codes for features such as autonomous tracking, dancing, 
7-segment display, and more will be presented in this repository.

Hello!
If you have stumbled along this project, please read below. We will include important details about the code, as well as things to look
out for. This repository will include many seperate codes that are entitled to do differing features. 

All of the codes initialize variables that connect voltages to specific pins. These will be labeled at the top of the code. Unless 
you are using the Elegoo Smart Robotic Car V1.0 (that is what we used), it is very likely that you will need to either change these
variables to fit your needs or change around the wiring to fit the pins that connect to the pins intialized in these variables.

As a heads up, most codes will require an ultrasonic sensor. We worked with a HC-sr04 sensor, however, other sensors may also be compatible.
There are some codes that utilize different instruments as well, such as line tracking modules.

We will shortly include another link to a GitHub account, which will include more codes for the same Elegoo Smart Robotic Car. 

Thank you and we hope this code may be useful for you.
